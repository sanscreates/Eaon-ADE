/**
 * Working out which conversation each pane is holding.
 *
 * Almost no session is started by the app. You open a plain shell and type
 * `claude`, and nothing in the pane's record — created as a shell, with no
 * agent and no command — ever learns otherwise. On the next launch that pane
 * faithfully restores what was saved, which is a bare shell, and the work is
 * gone. Watching for it is the only way to know.
 *
 * The link from a pane to a conversation cannot be read off disk. A transcript
 * records the folder, the branch and the model, but nothing about the terminal
 * it was typed into — no pid, no tty — and on this machine the process table
 * will not surrender another process's environment either, so the marker the
 * pane's shell carries cannot be read back out of the agent beneath it. What
 * the app does have is the pane's own shell: it spawned it and knows its pid.
 * So the agent is found by walking down from there, and the conversation is
 * identified in one of three ways, in this order of confidence:
 *
 *   1. The agent says so. Claude Code writes `sessions/<pid>.json` under its
 *      configuration directory naming the conversation that process holds.
 *      Written by the process about itself, so it is exact.
 *   2. The command line names it — `--resume` or `--session-id`.
 *   3. A transcript appears that was not there when the agent started.
 *
 * The third came first and was, on its own, wrong about the case that matters
 * most. It can only recognise a conversation that *begins* while something is
 * watching, and the sessions people actually want back are the ones that have
 * been running for hours: their transcripts were already on disk before the app
 * opened, so no arrival ever came and eleven panes out of fifteen were restored
 * as bare shells. Asking the agent which conversation it is holding answers
 * that outright, and answers it the moment the pane is seen rather than only
 * when somebody next speaks. The other two remain as fallbacks.
